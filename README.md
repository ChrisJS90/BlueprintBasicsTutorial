# BlueprintTutorial

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

In this tutorial I learned the basics of Unreal's Blueprints visual scripting. I've modified the construct script to randomly choose a material for an object when placed. I also added collision detection which triggers a boost in player speed and creates an effect emitter when the object is destroyed/ran over.
